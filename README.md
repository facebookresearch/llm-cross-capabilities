## üìú CrossEval: Benchmarking LLM Cross Capabilities

In real-world scenarios, many tasks require the intersection of multiple distinct capabilities across different types of expertise, which we refer to as **cross capabilities**. To explore this concept in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), we present the **CrossEval**, a benchmark consisting of 1,400 expert-annotated prompts, 4,200 model-generated responses, and 8,400 human ratings with explanations. CrossEval is designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs across 14 capabilities, including:

### Single Capabilities
- English
- Reasoning
- Coding
- Image Recognition
- Tool Use
- Long Context
- Spanish

### Cross Capabilities
- Coding & Reasoning
- Image Recognition & Reasoning
- Tool Use & Coding
- Tool Use & Reasoning
- Long Context & Coding
- Spanish & Reasoning
- Spanish & Image Recognition

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup
To get started, follow these steps to set up your Python environment:

```bash
conda create --name crosseval python=3.10
conda activate crosseval
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üì• Loading the CrossEval Dataset

The CrossEval dataset is hosted on Hugging Face. You can load it as follows:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("MingZhong/crosseval", split="test")
```

### Dataset Structure

Each instance in the dataset contains the following fields:

- **prompt_id**: Unique identifier for the prompt across capabilities
- **capability**: One of the 14 capabilities involved in the user prompt
- **difficulty**: Difficulty level of the prompt, categorized as 10% easy, 30% medium, 60% hard
- **l1_category**: High-level category for the user prompt
- **l2_category**: Subcategory for the user prompt
- **prompt**: The user-provided prompt text
- **attached_file**: URL of any attached file (used in image, long context, or tool use tasks)
- **response_i**: Model-generated responses (where `i=1,2,3` for multiple responses)
- **response_i_human_j_rating**: Human rating on a scale of 1-5 for each response (where `j=1,2` for multiple annotators)
- **response_i_human_j_explanation**: Human-provided explanations for the given rating

## üöÄ Generating Model Responses

To generate responses from different LLMs on the CrossEval dataset, ffollow the steps below.

### Setting API Keys
First, set up your API keys for the specified LLMs, ensuring compliance with the respective third-party terms of use.

```bash
export OPENAI_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"          # GPT
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key_here"   # Claude
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"      # Gemini
```

For tool use prompts involving  code execution, responses may include generated files (e.g., plots). In these cases, the files are uploaded to a Hugging Face repository, and the URLs are included in the responses. Therefore, if you intend to run these prompts, you‚Äôll also need to configure your Hugging Face API key:

```bash
export HF_KEY="your_huggingface_api_key_here"
```

Additionally, specify the account name and repository where the files will be saved at [this location](generate_response/models/gpt.py#L116).

### Generating Responses

Here‚Äôs an example script to generate responses using GPT-4o:

```bash
RESPONSE_DIR=outputs/responses
MODEL_NAME="gpt"
MODEL_VERSION="gpt-4o-2024-05-13"

python generate_response/generate.py \
    --save_path="${RESPONSE_DIR}/${MODEL_VERSION}.csv" \
    --model="${MODEL_NAME}" \
    --model_version="${MODEL_VERSION}" \
    --enable_code_interpreter \
```

Alternatively, you can execute the generation process using:

```bash
./scripts/get_response.sh
```

**Notes:**
- Update the `MODEL_NAME` and `MODEL_VERSION` in the script to match the specific model you want to evaluate.
- Model responses are saved as `{MODEL_VERSION}.csv` in the `RESPONSE_DIR` directory.
- The script supports resuming from the last processed instance if interrupted. Re-run the script to resume where it left off.

## üìä Running Evaluations

To evaluate the generated responses, execute the following command:

```bash
MODEL_VERSION="gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
RESPONSE_DIR=outputs/responses
SCORE_DIR=outputs/scores
EVALUATOR=gpt

python evaluation/evaluate_response.py \
    --response=${MODEL_VERSION}_response \
    --response_file=${RESPONSE_DIR}/${MODEL_VERSION}.csv \
    --save_path=${SCORE_DIR}/${MODEL_VERSION}_response_${EVALUATOR}_score.csv \
    --evaluator=${EVALUATOR}
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```bash
./scripts/evaluate.sh
```

**Notes:**
- The script supports resuming from the last processed instance in case of an error. Simply re-run the script to continue the evaluation.
- The script will print the average scores for each capability after evaluation.
- Detailed scores for each prompt are saved in the `SCORE_DIR` directory.

## üóÇÔ∏è Model Outputs

We provide the responses and evaluations for the GPT and Llama model families on the CrossEval benchmark, available in [outputs/scores](outputs/scores) for reference.

Additionally, CrossEval is the largest meta-evaluation benchmark for examining correlations between LLM and human ratings. We release the LLM-generated ratings for reference responses in the [outputs/correlations](outputs/correlations) directory.

To compute correlation metrics between LLM and human ratings, run:

```bash
./scripts/get_correlation.sh
```
